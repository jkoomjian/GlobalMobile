    Display any page as if it's on a mobile device

    Some websites have an overwhelming number of images and headlines and ads
    all screaming for your attention simultaneously. Our poor brains spin into
    overdrive just to interpret all these distractions. GlobalMobile aims to
    restore your sanity by reducing and simplifying the content on these
    websites. It does this with an uncomplicated trick: Many of the worst
    offending websites actually have nice mobile versions, with just a single
    column of content to scroll through. Global Mobile displays this mobile
    version of a site in your browser (It doesn't change the size of your
    browser window, just the content). How it works: By default Global Mobile
    will not change anything- As you encounter overly complicated pages, click
    'Add To Whitelist' in the GlobalMobile menu. From then on, GlobalMobile
    will display the mobile version for all pages on the site. To undo this
    change, select 'Remove From Whitelist' in the GlobalMobile menu.
